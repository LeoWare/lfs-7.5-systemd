Linux from Scratch automated building scripts
---------------------------------------------

I've been through the Linux from Scratch books several times.
This time, I'm beginning to automate my process.

To start, I created bash scripts by copying the instructions out of the PDF version
of the book. Then I added 'echo' statements to let the user know what it's doing.

There is a project called Automated Linux from Scratch (ALFS) that aims to automate
the building of an LFS system. I created these scripts just to save typing.

My goal is to automate a system build, create a system installer, and software repository
for my build of Linux from Scratch.
